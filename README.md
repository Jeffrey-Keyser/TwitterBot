# TwitterBot
There is one file that I haven't added because it contains my specific API key and as this domain is public I decided to not 
publish it.

The hardest part was understanding the Twitter API, the code is very simple.

One limiting factor when considering this bot is that you have to keep your program running for it to go through your whole text file.
If I could run this through a cloud device it would solve that problem easily but alas.

At the moment, the bot only retweets a tweet every hour or so that I don't get flagged by the Twitter Police.
Goal is to enter into some contests and win some stupid prizes!

See Twitter Handle - @QuinnLeven <- This is the bot.
