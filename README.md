# TwitterBot
There is one file that I haven't added because it contains my specific API key and as this domain is public I decided to not 
publish it.

The hardest part understanding the Twitter API, the code is very simple.

One limiting factor about this bot is that you have to keep your program running for it to go through your whole text file.
If I could run this through a cloud device it would solve that problem easily but alas.
